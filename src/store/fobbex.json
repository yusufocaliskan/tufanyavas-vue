However, nothing moves in a straight line. We know that after every five waves, a three-wave correction occurs which can now come to an end with an\u0026nbsp; (A)-(B)-(C) expanded flat correction. A recovery back above 0.63 will put bulls back in play.

We talked about this in our 2022 updates and warned about a bearish turning point which is now in full progress and will most likely resume much lower as pair shows an impulsive drop for wave A. However, nothing moves in a straight line, so wave (B) rise is not a surprise either, which appears completed after recent nice break out of an upward channel.

    "content": "\u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"\u003eBTCUSD is sharply and impulsively up away from 19k support area, so bulls can be still here. With recent break above 25k previous highs by five waves, there can be room for more upside, especially if current 26k-25k support area holds as an A-B-C pullback. If we will see further rally towards 30k and higher, then we might start considering the steepest wave (3), however, any bigger drop decisively below 24k level would be most likely signal for at least a temporary top and higher degree corrective decline.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eBig picture\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"\u003eThe decline from all-time highs is approaching the equality support at 78.6% Fib level, so technically bears may slow down in 2023 at 12k-15k support.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n",
    "previous_content": "\u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"\u003eBTCUSD keeps moving nicely higher in the 4-hour chart, so seems like leading diagonal into wave (A)/(1) from the lows is still in progress. However, we see key level here around 25k-26k area, from where we can expect a corrective pullback in wave (B)/(2), unless it alternatively explodes into very bullish wave 3. However, still keep an eye on bearish count #2 as recent recovery can be also as part of a complex correction in wave 4 that can retest the lows for wave 5.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eBig picture\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"\u003eA three-wave decline from all-time highs is approaching the equality support at 78.6% Fib level, so technically bears may slow down this year at 12k-18k support. Also, watch the daily downward channel for any changes in a direction if the big line from the all-time high is broken.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, BTCUSD remains nicely and impulsively bearish in the 4-hour\u0026nbsp;chart\u0026nbsp;and with current break out of projected wave 4 triangle pattern, seems like final wave 5 of C is now in progress that can ideally stop here around key do/die 18k/17k area. Just please keep in mind that only strong bounce and impulsive recovery back above 31500 level would be signal for bulls. As long as the price is above 14000 level, bulls are still valid.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBTCUSD is coming sharply down in the 4-hour chart after we noticed a completed corrective rally and it more and more looks like a bearish impulse that can take us much lower. However, based on two different daily interpretations, for now we are still tracking wave (C) or (3), but we will keep an eye closely on an upcoming recovery. If will be slow and in three waves only, then it will be a correction in wave (4) with resistance around 42000k level, but any strong and impulsive rebound back above 44200 level would be signal that bulls are back.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBTCUSD stopped at channel resistance line for wave (C) and turned sharply down in the 4-hour chart, which means that (A)-(B)-(C) corrective rally is completed and we can now expect a new decline at least in three waves (A)/(1)-(B)/(2)-(C)/(3) towards 40k or lower. Any strong bearish acceleration below 37700 region would be most likely signal for wave (3) of a five-wave bearish impulse.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, BTCUSD looks to be still trading bearish in the 4-hour chart, so we are still tracking a five-wave cycle within wave (C) or (3) that can send the price at least down to 30k level for wave (C) if not even lower for wave (3). Keep in mind that BTC is bearish as long as it\u0026#39;s trading below strong trendline connected from the highs and below 43500 invalidation/bullish confirmation level.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, BTCUSD came nicely lower in the 4-hour chart, but we might be at some important levels now, so at this stage we are tracking two counts. In the primary count, BTCUSD may have a completed five-wave cycle within wave (C), while in the second scenario, a five-wave cycle within wave (C)/(3) could be still in progress. So, the key we will be an upcoming intraday recovery; if will be slow in three waves only, then we can expect more weakness for wave 5, but any stronger and bigger rally back above 40k region would be signal for the bottom and bullish reversal.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, BTCUSD is coming even lower in the 4-hour chart after a retest of December 2021 lows, ideally within wave (C) or (3) and there can be room for more weakness, at least towards 33k-31k area for wave (C) if not even lower for wave (3) down below 30k. So, we remain bearish and we should be aware of more downside pressure while the price is below strong trendline connected from the highs and 43500 invalidation level.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBTCUSD is bearish in the 4-hour chart since the price reached new ATH but only with three waves, so ideally that was big wave B as part of a big flat or a triangle formation, which means that we are now trading in wave C with room for more weakness in the near future as rally from 43400 unfolded in three waves that ideally belongs to a wave (4). A broken trendline decisively can be another confirmation for further weakness within wave (5) towards 40k area or lower.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n",
